# Twitter Clone
Visit [https://tarunravi.tech/twitterCloneReact/](https://tarunravi.tech/twitterCloneReact/) to view the project! Feel free to type something into the "What's happening?" box, and if you want you can add an image URL into the "Enter Image URL" box. When you're done click Tweet! This will publish your Tweet to the world! You can scroll down and see your tweet!

If you use a smaller device (mobile) the website will automatically shrink the sidebar, and remove the widgets page. 

## Technologies
I used React to build the website and Firebase for the tweet database. Material UI was used for the Icons and buttons.
